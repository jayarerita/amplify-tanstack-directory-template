- **Multiple sorting options**: Relevance, distance, rating, date, name (A-Z)
- **Rich listing cards**: Images, ratings, contact info, distance display
- **Loading states**: Skeleton loaders during search
- **Empty states**: Helpful messaging when no results found

**Key Features:**
- Sponsored listing badges with tier indicators (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
- Distance calculation and display when location is provided
- Star rating visualization
- Category tags and feature highlights
- Responsive card layout

### 4. Robust Search Backend (`search.ts`)

- **Flexible filtering**: Text search, category, location, price, rating, features
- **Intelligent sorting**: Sponsored listings always prioritized, then by selected criteria
- **Distance calculation**: Haversine formula for accurate distance computation
- **Faceted search**: Dynamic filter options based on current results
- **Demo data fallback**: Works with demo data when backend is unavailable

**Key Features:**
- Multi-criteria filtering with AND/OR logic
- Radius-based location filtering
- Relevance scoring algorithm
- Facet calculation for dynamic filter options
- Graceful degradation to demo data

### 5. Location Services (`geolocation.ts`)

- **Current location detection**: HTML5 Geolocation API integration
- **Distance calculations**: Haversine formula implementation
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error messages for location failures
- **Distance formatting**: Human-readable distance display (feet/miles)

### 6. Search State Management (`useSearch.ts`)

- **Centralized search state**: Custom hook for managing search operations
- **Query caching**: TanStack Query integration for efficient data fetching
- **Location management**: Current location detection and management
- **Suggestion handling**: Debounced suggestion fetching

### 7. Demo Data Integration (`demo-data.ts`)

- **Realistic test data**: 8 sample listings across various categories
- **Complete data model**: All fields populated for testing
- **Sponsored examples**: Mix of sponsored and regular listings
- **Geographic diversity**: Multiple locations for location-based testing

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
- `SearchInterface`: Main search input with auto-completion
- `SearchFilters`: Comprehensive filtering sidebar
- `SearchResults`: Results display with sorting
- `PopularSearches`: Trending searches and categories

### Backend Services
- `searchOperations`: Main search API with filtering and sorting
- `geolocation utilities`: Location services and distance calculations
- `demo data`: Fallback data for development and testing

### State Management
- TanStack Query for server state and caching
- Custom `useSearch` hook for search state management
- URL-based state persistence for shareable search results

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced search input (300ms)
- Query result caching with TanStack Query
- Lazy loading of suggestions
- Efficient distance calculations
- Optimized re-renders with React.memo patterns

## Usage Examples

### Basic Search
```tsx
<SearchInterface 
  placeholder="Search businesses..."
  onSearch={(query) => console.log(query)}
/>
```

### Advanced Search Page
```tsx
<SearchFilters
  filters={filters}
  onFiltersChange={setFilters}
  facets={facets}
/>
<SearchResults
  results={results}
  sortBy="relevance"
  onSortChange={handleSort}
/>
```

### Programmatic Search
```tsx
const results = await searchOperations.search({
  query: "pizza",
  categories: ["restaurants"],
  location: { city: "New York", radius: 10 },
  minRating: 4,
  sortBy: "rating"
});
```

## Testing

- Unit tests for search operations
- Component tests for UI interactions
- Integration tests for search flows
- Demo data for consistent testing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Elasticsearch Integration**: Replace basic filtering with full-text search
2. **Machine Learning**: Personalized search results based on user behavior
3. **Voice Search**: Speech-to-text search input
4. **Saved Searches**: User ability to save and manage search queries
5. **Search Analytics**: Track popular searches and optimize results
6. **Advanced Geocoding**: Integration with Google Places API for better location handling

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- Geolocation API support for location features
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-responsive design for all screen sizes

This implementation provides a comprehensive, production-ready search and filtering system that meets all specified requirements while maintaining excellent performance and user experience.
